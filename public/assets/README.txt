This folder is intended to contain the candidate's ATS-friendly CV file.

Please replace the placeholder file named `Rabbani_CV_2025.pdf` with your real PDF or DOCX resume. The website's "Download CV" button links to `/assets/Rabbani_CV_2025.pdf`.

If you don't have the PDF ready, you can keep a plain-text fallback or an HTML resume here temporarily.
